README for PA1
=================================
For PA1, we wrote 5 algorithms in serialized form as a base for later parallelization attempts.
We also created a build system and test suite that we should be able to use and/or build on in 
future projects.

====  I. Getting The Source Code ===================

The PA1 library is being actively developed, and new functionalities
are being added. You can get the latest source code from this git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/kalyanbhetwal/CS430
    
 


==== II. Quick Start ===============

  A. Building PA1

---- A. Building PA1 ----------

If you want to do a quick build, first check that you have required packages
installed (see Requirements section below), then run:
    make
    make fibonacci_main 
    make leibniz_main 
    make monte-carlo_main 
    make matrix-vector_main 
    make matrix-matrix_main 
    make pa1_test
    
---- B. Running Kernels for PA1 ----------
If you want to run the individual kernels please use the below commands:
     ${PA1_HOME}/build/bin/<kenel_names> <input>

==== III. Building PA1 from Source =======================

    Build Command Sequence
        make
        make all
    Build individual Kernels
         make fibonacci_main 
         make leibniz_main 
         make monte-carlo_main 
         make matrix-matrix_main  
         make matrix-vector_main 
       
    Build and Test without creating an install directory
        make
        make pa1_test


    Requirements
        * make: version 4.2.1 known to work

        * automake: version 1.16.1 known to work

        * C++ compiler, the below versions are known to work
            Mac i686-apple-darwin10-g++-4.2.1,
            GCC 4.6.3 20120306 (Red Hat 4.6.3-2)



Please notify us if you find that other versions of these tools that
work or do not work for you.



==== IV. Running Tests =====

The ${PA1_HOME}/bin/build/pa1_test binary can be executed to run the tests of
the various components of PA1. Additionally, from the root of the
distribution you can run 'make test' to run these same tests.

The gtest framework is used for writing and running unit tests.  Information
on gtest can be found at:

    http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

and introductory documentation is at:

==== V. Documentation =====


PI: Leibniz's Series:
The Leibniz program computes the constant PI to a given precision (number of
decimal places) using the Leibniz formula for PI: PI = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + ...
To compute PI accurately to n digits, you need at least 10^n terms, so only a 
relatively small number of digits can be computed in a reasonable amount of time.

PI: Monte Carlo:
The Monte Carlo algorithm calculates PI by imagining a circle inside a square,
where the diameter of the circle is the same as the side length of the square.
N random points are randomly chosen within the square and checked if they land
within the circle as well. Then, the ratio of points inside the circle to total
points tested (N) is multiplied by 4. The result should be a close estimate of
the value of PI, with the number being more accurate with a higher N.

Matrix-Vector Multiply:
The Matrix Vector Multiply kernel takes a matrix and vector as input and multiplies them.

Matrix-Matrix Multiply:
The Matrix Matrix Multiply kernel takes two matrix as input and multiplies them.


Fibonacci Numbers:
The Fibonacci program computes the n-th Fibonacci Number using a recursive function
which is based on the defined recursive relation F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) if n > 1, 
F(1) = 1, F(0) = 0. It can be shown that the Fibonacci Numbers grow exponentially, so
F(n) can be reasonably be computed only for rather small n (say n < 94).
